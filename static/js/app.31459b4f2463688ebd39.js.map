methods、computed, components, filters 和 directives，将被合并为同一个对象, 两个对象键名冲突时，优先级顺序同created初始化方向相反,同上</p>\n    <p>4. 混入里面也可以嵌套混入，规则同上，最后在组件初始化时将层层\"递归合并\"</p>\n    <p>5. watch对象也是合并成数组，触发顺序同钩子函数</p>\n

Vue对于每一类选项都有自己的混入策略和规则，如：Vue.config.optionMergeStrategies.methods，参考源码我们可以改变各个选项的合并策略，或者\n    当我们为Vue实例增加了新的选项时，也可以自定义新选项的混入策略，比如：Vue.config.optionMergeStrategies.newOption = {自定义...} 或\n
